one day i was in my house then a monster popped up out of nowhere from the top of my bunk bed.

(i'm 18) i got really scared because he was so big and ugly that i screamed and got up and slept in my parents room the rest of the day.

that night i saw him again but it was on my parents bed i could see it from my own window.

that same night i also saw my sister in my room laughing and said to my sister where did the monster go. she got scared and kept laughing until she threw her pillow at me and ran out of my room, i saw her again in my room again, i could also see my bro and sisters toys, so i grabbed them and put them in my bed so i couldn't see them anymore.

then i saw my brothers red tube tops hanging up on my door knob, so i thought nothing of it until i see the same thing and i turn around and the creature was standing in my doorway watching me.

i got really scared and was shaking.

that night i woke up because i had an awful nightmare about the creature.

the next day my brother and i were in the living room just talking about nothing then all of a sudden my bro jumped up and grabbed his neck and started crying.

my dad was freaking out so he drove us to a doctors office then my bro and my dad left me and my dad went to my grandmothers house.

we were there playing with her cat and the lights went out.

i saw a ball floating in the air and it was black.

then it turned red then yellow then orange then blue, it changed into a person and floated up into the air then it left.

i got really freaked out and i said something to my dad then the lights came back on and i left my grama and my dad.
